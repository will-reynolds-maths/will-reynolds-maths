## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Will Reynolds (he/him) and I'm a mathematician and public engagement professional based in Edinburgh, Scotland. I have a PhD in algebraic geometry from the University of Edinburgh and continued to work for the University until May 2025. Besides maths, I'm trying to get better at programming and at chess - sometimes using the former to help with the latter.

### Background
Between 2020 and 2025 I did a lot of work with the University of Edinburgh's Mathematics Outreach Team, first as a volunteer during my PhD and later as Mathematics Outreach and Widening Participation Manager. You can find out more about the amazing outreach work done by the School of Mathematics on their webpages (some of which I wrote): https://maths.ed.ac.uk/outreach

### Current interests
I'm currently learning about software and web development, and would like to learn more about modern data analysis.

### Previous work
In 2018 I started a PhD under the supervision of Dr Milena Hering, and I graduated in 2023. My focus was an area of maths called toric geometry, which studies a special class of high-dimensional shapes (called "normal toric varieties") through a very special connection they have with ordinary polyhedra (things with planar, flat surfaces like pyramids, cubes and prisms; not cylinders or spheres, because they have rounded sides). Specifically, my thesis was on slope stability of tangent sheaves on toric Fano varieties, and you can find it here: https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/40752

Between 2018 and 2025, I spent many wonderful hours tutoring undergraduates in small group tutorials called workshops. I've tutored on all of the following topics:
 - Proof writing
 - Linear algebra (both introductory and more abstract)
 - Calculus
 - Real analysis
 - Groups, rings and modules
 - Differential equations
 - Python programming (including the use of SageMath)
 - Complex analysis
 - Differential geometry
 - Elementary number theory
 - Algebraic topology
 - Galois theory
 - Algebraic geometry
